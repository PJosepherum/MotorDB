# MotorDB
Vagrant, Foundation, Phalcon, MySQL

# Features
The vehicles CRUD works as expected. Images are stored in the database encoded in base64.

Things like blog, session management and user registration have not been implemented.

I took a few liberties with the design. I wanted to get some usable example complete in a reasonable amount of time, or I'd have been tweaking it forever.
