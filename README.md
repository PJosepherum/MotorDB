# MotorDB
This was an example application I created for Just Develop It to demonstrate that I could quickly learn to utilise new technologies, having previously not worked with the particlular MVC.

It is incomplete, but I did spend 50 consecutive hours (sleep is for the weak) to show my determination.

# Tehcnologies
Vagrant, Foundation, Phalcon, MySQL

# Installation
Run `vagrant up` in the cloned directory, then visit `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.

# Features
The vehicles CRUD works as expected. Images are stored in the database encoded in base64.

Things like blog, session management and user registration have not been implemented.

I took a few liberties with the design. I wanted to get some usable example complete in a reasonable amount of time, or I'd have been tweaking it forever.
